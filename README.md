####Introduction
This is an XJTU thesis LaTeX template forked from [xjtuthesis](https://github.com/Aetf/xjtuthesis) v0.6.6, which was maintained by Weisi Dai et al. I've done some modifications for my personal use.

I will add some .tex files that demonstrate the TeX file structure of this template, as well as a detailed usage instruction in the future.

####Changelog
- 2016-05-27 and before
1. Fixed bug, tuned position of header. Now it look the same as the official `.doc` template.
2. Tuned header ruler appearance and position.
3. Use `Computer Modern` font in math mode, which looks better.
4. Reduced warning.
5. Aligned footnote mark to text margin.
6. Tuned line space in footnote.
7. Replace the brackets with full-width ones to imitate the official template.
