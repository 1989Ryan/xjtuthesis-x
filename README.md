####Introduction
This is an XJTU thesis LaTeX template forked from [xjtuthesis](https://github.com/Aetf/xjtuthesis) v0.6.6, which was maintained by Weisi Dai et al. I've done some modifications for my personal use.

I will add some .tex files that demonstrate the TeX file structure of this template, as well as a detailed usage instruction in the future. Before that, please take the following steps to start your writing.
1. Download/clone [xjtuthesis](https://github.com/Aetf/xjtuthesis), you can start your writing by modifying the `.tex` files in the `solution` foler.
2. Download/clone files `xjtuthesis.cls` and `gbt7714-2005-xjtu.bst` in this repository to `solution` folder for compilation.
In fact, `gbt7714-2005-xjtu.bst` in two repositories are the same since I did not modify it.
